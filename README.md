# AI Orgin

It works as a conversation starter at first saying "hello human." so you reply either
"hello", "hey", "hi" and then after it will throw a random response out of an array.
Working on new basic questions and obvious responses.

PROBLEMS:
- Calc function will not work, working on an if statement where you say two numbers and it will add them for you.
- Creating a database to store responses that it learns over time form people.

This will be a bot that will learn as you talk to it. As of now it knows only what I have programmed it to say but the project is not finished.
If you have any questions or want to help out send me an eamil.

P.S. Only use code for knowledge purposes as I have the source trademarked. Thank you.
